# AE2Things
Neat little additions to AE2: Forge


This fork was created to allow the Fuzzy Card and Inverter Card to be put on DISK's in 1.18.2. 
All changes were made to the 1.18 branch.
I made this for my Vault Hunters world. It was pretty easy. 
I did not write any new code, just took the code from the update and moved it to an older version so all credit still goes to Technici4n.

Original README:

This mod adds a new type of cell the DISK: Deep Item Storage disK. This cell has no type limits and one item counts as one byte. Due to limitations with the cell format, you lose 24 bytes per kibibyte, but hey a small price to pay for no types right?
